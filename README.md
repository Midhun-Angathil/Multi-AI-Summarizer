# Multi AI Summarizer:

Its function is simple:

If you are the kind of person who wants to check responses of all the existing top providers such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cohere and Perplexity and then summarize the response you want based on all of these responses (like an ensemble model!), then this project helps you with that. 

Just ask your question and you get the aggregated response or a unified summary.
